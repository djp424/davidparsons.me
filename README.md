# davidparsons.me

Personal site. Next.js 16 (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4, MDX content, deployed on Vercel.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How it's put together

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Routes. `app/[slug]/` renders posts at the top level so the old WordPress URLs still work. |
| `content/notes/*.mdx` | The posts, with frontmatter. Filename is the URL slug. |
| `content/speaking.ts` | Every talk, with its venue link and any video/case-study links. |
| `lib/notes.ts` | Reads and sorts the MDX files. |
| `lib/site.ts` | Name, URL, email, nav and social links — one place to change them. |
| `components/mdx-components.tsx` | Prose styling for post bodies. |
| `design/` | The design canvas artboards the visual direction came from. Not part of the build. |

### Design tokens

Colours and fonts live in one `@theme` block at the top of `app/globals.css`.
The design is a single warm paper ground with one ink colour and no accent —
links are a hairline that firms up on hover (`.lk`), not a colour change.

## Adding a post

Drop a `.mdx` file in `content/notes/`. The filename becomes the URL.

```mdx
---
title: "A Post"
date: "2026-09-12"
category: "General"   # optional
excerpt: "One sentence for the index and the feed."
---

Body goes here.
```

It appears on `/notes`, in `/rss.xml` and in `/sitemap.xml` automatically.

## Contact form

`/contact` posts to a Server Action (`app/contact/actions.ts`) that delivers
through [Resend](https://resend.com). Without the env vars below the form
fails closed with a visible message pointing at the email address in
`lib/site.ts` — it never pretends to have sent.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `CONTACT_FROM` — an address on a domain verified in Resend
- `CONTACT_TO` — optional, defaults to `site.email`

Protections: a honeypot field, one submission per IP per 30s, five per hour.
The rate limit is in-memory, so it is per-instance and resets on deploy.

## Redirects from the old site

Handled in `next.config.ts`: `/feed` to `/rss.xml`, and the WordPress
`/category/*` and `/author/*` archives to `/notes`. Post URLs are unchanged.
